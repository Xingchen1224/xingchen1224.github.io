## Overview

This advanced web application platform demonstrates modern full-stack development practices, implementing real-time collaboration features and sophisticated data analytics. Built with scalability and performance in mind, it serves thousands of daily active users.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket-based live editing and commenting system
- **Advanced Analytics**: Custom dashboard with interactive data visualizations
- **Microservices Architecture**: Scalable backend services with API gateway
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline functionality and mobile responsiveness
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and deployment

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Material-UI** for consistent design system
- **React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching

### Backend Services
- **Node.js** with Express.js framework
- **PostgreSQL** with Prisma ORM for data modeling
- **Redis** for session management and caching
- **JWT** for secure authentication

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** containerization for all services
- **AWS ECS** for container orchestration
- **CloudFront** CDN for global content delivery
- **RDS** for managed database hosting
